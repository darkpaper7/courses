== No "I" in Team

Many of us are familiar with the joy and fulfillment of cranking out code, on our own, for class assignments.
It's truly exhilarating! You feel like you have the the world at your fingertips and can wrangle the problem
into submission with merely a QWERTY (or DVORAK if you're into that sort of thing) keyboard at your disposal.

This gets completely turned on it's head once you are among the professional developer ranks. When working in
teams one thing that becomes blatantly obvious is that multiple developers/engineers with different opinions, expeiences,
and perspectives can often come up with wildly varying approaches to solving a given problem.

Because of this it's key that we have a common means by which to communicate the pros/cons of one approach versus another.

Algorithms and Algorithmic Complexity Analysis to the rescue!

= The Joy of Cooking

The Joy of Cooking is one of the best selling and most critically acclaimed Cookbooks of all time.

I'd also like to make the claim that in another sense its also one of the best selling algorithms books of all time.

What is a recipe? 

> noun. a set of instructions for preparing a particular dish, including a list of the ingredients required.

Algorithms are essentially __very, very precise__ recipes.

Algorithms have precisely defined inputs (ingredients) and an a precise, finite set of steps to produce an expected output (finished dish).

The biggest difference is that cooking is often imprecise (i.e. a pinch of salt, a dash of pepper) which is hard to measure. Algorithms, as a neccessity for proving correctness over time have to be much more precise/specific.

In a nutshell, if you can give directions, or teach grandma's peach cobbler recipe (with precision), you're already an algorist.

= Activity: Introduction To Miro (formerly known as RealTimeBoard)

1. Please visit the following url: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kldKklM=/.
2. We'll provide the password for the board in the Zoom chat.

Miro is a digital whiteboard collaboration tool that we'll use to make our virtual classroom more like an in person experience.

It's large enough for us all to have our own space and work in private and will help facilitate share backs in a seamless way.

We'll largely be drawing arrows, graphs, and writing text and some smallish code snippets feel free to use your favorite text editor and paste into the Miro board if that's easier :).
