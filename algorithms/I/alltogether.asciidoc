= Whiteboard Interview Best Practices/Tips

The dirty (or maybe not so dirty) little secret of technical interviewing is that it's largely a very social experiment. Most interviewers are looking to determine whether or not the candidate is: a) Smart b) able to communicate their ideas effective and c) someone they could consider working and thriving with on a team.

To that end there are a few guidelines I often encourage everyone to incorporate into their aresenal as it pertains to technical interviewing:

=== Restating/Clarifying The Question

=== Validating/Invalidating Assumptions

=== Modeling the Problem

=== Vocalizing the Initial Approach

=== Code it Cleanly

=== Iterative Improvement
