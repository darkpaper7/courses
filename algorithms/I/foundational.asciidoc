= The Peanut Butter to Algorithms' Jelly: Data Structures

If algorithms are the recipe, then Data Structures are the knives, cutting boards, board scrapers, whisks etc. that we use to craft delicious solutions. They're our tools.

To create software effectively at any level it requires using BOTH data structures and algorithms in tandem.

=== What is a data structure?

Generally a data structure is a well understood, standardized container for information that a program can leverage to do its work. 

Each data structure has it's own semantics and common performance characteristics for usage. Here's a quick recap:

= Arrays/Lists

= Stacks/Queues

= Maps/Dictionaries

= Trees/Graphs

= Big Omega aka "The Best Case"

Big Omega is commonly referred to as the "Best Case" performance.

= Big O aka "The Worst Case"

Big Oh is commonly referred to as the "Worst Case" performance. It is also subsequently the mostly commonly referenced of all the BIGs.
 
= Big Theta aka "The Average Case"

Big Theta is the _fanciest_ of the bunch. It is also commonly referred to as the "Average Case" performance.
